# Web Automation - E-Commerce application using Selenium WebDriver and Java

# Problem Statement:

# Automation HighLights Highlights:
- Data cleaning: Dealing with list values/nested string values in the dataset
    - For example, A particular movie can belong to multiple Genres (like Drama, Comedy)
    - In such cases, the data were presented as follows: Dramas, Comedy
    - We have used Python string functions and pandas effectively to handle such data
- We have performed extensive EDA to address the business problem.
    - Throughout the notebook, we have frequently plotted a lot of graphs and used methods like pd.melt, pd.pivot, pd.pivot_table to restructure the       data in order to get the desired information
    - We have performed the EDA on movies and tv-shows separately and finally compared the two together
